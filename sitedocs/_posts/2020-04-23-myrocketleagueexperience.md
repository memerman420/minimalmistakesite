> So I recently started playing rocket league and after 10 or so hours I thought I should share how I fared while playing rocket league. Here is a clip to show you my natural skill at this car ball game:

To be clear this is not my first time playing rl. I was first introduced to this game at a library where it was installed into one of their computers, so naturally I gave it a go. My first thoughts were: "eh, I don't really get this game", and I left it there. Two years later I saw that the game was 50% off, so I brought it. Normally, I would have not brought the game, but I was incredibly bored of having nothing to play. This was due to my gaming laptop having broken a few months before hand and my current laptop being a potato.

So, due to limited technical specs, I started to play rl...  
Only to assaulted by ranks way above me. Same deal with the casual playlist. Much of my starting hours were dominated by watching cars dribble the ball way over my head(bonnet?). So after getting humiliated time after time in ranked, I finally started to take on players closer to my skill level. I would say that this is the point when rl actually got *fun*. While I still mostly beaten by opponents who had more experience in the rank, I was at least able to put up a fight.  
RL can get extremely frustrating to say the least. "Why can't I just **hit** the ball", and "How do I keep losing possesion of the ball". Although do keep in mind that I do *suck*.  

I give Rocket League 8.5/10 due to its tremondous skill ceiling, even though huge learning curve is common in many popular games.  
A final clip to showcase my abilty or lack thereof.
