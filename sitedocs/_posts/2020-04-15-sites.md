### Movies/T.V shows
> [MoviesFlix](https://moviesflix.mobi/latest-released/)
   
Requires a bit of patience(3-5 redirects), but works perfectly fine, downloads fast and the site is updated very frequently.
>[PopcornTime](https://popcorntime.app/)

Go on the site, download the application. Set where you you would like to put your downloads. and ignore the warning about the VPN it gives you (you can turn your [vpn](http://betternet.com/) if you're genuinely scared) and you're done. I use this application when [MoviesFlix](https://moviesflix.mobi/latest-released/) doesn't serve my needs. Also is updated very frequently(sometimes faster than [MoviesFlix](https://moviesflix.mobi/latest-released/)).

### Anime
> [AnimeList](https://animelist.pw/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=73388069748bdcc693ec442dfac7b6a82c5237a2-1583541912-0-AWjBElONdFKcW2iBUFp7n0FsxhK7CBmxy9CpDOf9G8H4JNEhyScB-uwk2Dq-k2Xr1c295XKSFMg6ZtlJ6EWwIBHu5bnhfAZf5bTP6foQn-D2WgdDauStmvX6r6Dx2pnBnx5XDyUE0dYuucpgkNculErUjGWppMmZ5ILRY9CcNvFibYvGtTk-PPl1uTB5jZ4M5OtTe9y4KshMwM8IRcw6eatdij2vq8s0Wt2OdNS_wG9FE6QSDoN_p3H-fDQQHEPgs8TwiX6FxqWo13STdbif4_8)

An okay site for downloading Anime, but there is not much to compare it to as it is one of the only sites that work for downlaoding anime. Would be an even better site but download speeds can vary a **lot**. Downloading episodes in batched can be really tiresome. I'm currently searching for a way to make this easier and I've found some promising results on Github. A certain program that runs on python and downloads episodes for you. I'll update this when I'm certain it works.
>Update:

After testing different ways on downloading anime, I've found a solution that works for me. Using [Jdownloader](https://jdownloader.org/download/index) paired with [AnimeList](https://animelist.pw/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=73388069748bdcc693ec442dfac7b6a82c5237a2-1583541912-0-AWjBElONdFKcW2iBUFp7n0FsxhK7CBmxy9CpDOf9G8H4JNEhyScB-uwk2Dq-k2Xr1c295XKSFMg6ZtlJ6EWwIBHu5bnhfAZf5bTP6foQn-D2WgdDauStmvX6r6Dx2pnBnx5XDyUE0dYuucpgkNculErUjGWppMmZ5ILRY9CcNvFibYvGtTk-PPl1uTB5jZ4M5OtTe9y4KshMwM8IRcw6eatdij2vq8s0Wt2OdNS_wG9FE6QSDoN_p3H-fDQQHEPgs8TwiX6FxqWo13STdbif4_8) works wonder for me. However, ther are times when animelist.pw cuases slow download speeds. But apart from those times, this method is excellent.

### A note on the vpn
A reliable free vpn that connects to America. I would not reccommend this vpn for anything other than getting around blocks as it significantly reduces you network speed.
