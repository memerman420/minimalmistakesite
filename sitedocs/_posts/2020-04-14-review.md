title: A review - Deception Point - Dan Brown

### Reviewing Deception Point

So I recently finished Deception Point by Dan Brown and like Dan Brown's other novels, I have to say I'm impressed. This book features:
- Politics
- Ice
- A certain meteorite
- Presidency
 
Deception point is one of two stand alone books that Dan Brown has written, the other being, Digital fortress. I love the little tid bits of real like knowledge that Dan brown seamlessly integrates into an action packed plot. For the majority of time I spent reading the book, I was confident I knew everything about the big reveal that was ineveitable. However, Dan Brown being Dan brown, turned my reading experience upside down with an extremely well though-out twist.

### Characters
We are able to get relief from Robert Langdon and his constant reminders on how incredibly fit he is for his age. Meet Rachael Sexton, working for the current president while her dad attempts to remove the current president from his office by replacing him. Interesting situation right? It gets better if you read the book.

### Conclusion/Thoughts
I really enoyed reasing this book and if you have enjoyed other Dan Brown novels, then I highly recommend this book to you. Much enjoyable, lots of suspense, and tips on how to win your very own presidential elction.

8/10
